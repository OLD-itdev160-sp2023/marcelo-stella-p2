PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
I decided to build a Hangman Game using JavaScript that accepts user input and runs a function based on the result.

FEATURE LIST
1. Input box
2. New Game Button
3. Guess button
4. Enter key to submit guess
5. Hide Hangman limbs after a wrong guess

TECHNICAL TASKS

INPUT BOX: Returns user's input to be compared to an internal word bank.
NEW GAME BUTTON: Meant to reset and run the game with a new word at any time.
GUESS BUTTON / ENTER KEY: The app will return the input wether the user clicks the button or hits enter.
HIDING LIMBS: Using a JS function, I was able to "hide" the limbs. I just changed the color to the same as the background
            to make them think it has disappeared.
